		 		<h4>More About Me.</h4>
		 		<p>See the huge puzzling face on the left? Yep, that's me. Always trying to learn and always puzzling how to be better while not losing myself.</p>
		 		<p>I am Chi Zhang. Your sterotypical and not that sterotypical Chinese guy. Nerdy? Yeah, a bit. Tough? Well, a bit. Tough guy? Hell no! See, I love what I do, otherwise I won't do it, right? But besides I am a software engineer or say, nerd. I am gym guy, trying to be a mussle guy. I played piano for 4 years (though how to play it had been long forgotten). I played trumpet for 3 years (still can play it~). I have a 1st dan in Taekwondo. I practiced traditional Chinese martial art for 2 years. Yeah, sounds a bit not so typical right?</p>
		 		<p>If you think I am a loose cannon or hot tempered guy, you are wrong. I am quite a nice guy if you have a chance to know me. I cover my friends' backs. I help whoever I meet that need help. I love animals, or cats in particular. And in fact I am a cat guy! I mean who can resist those furry balls!</p>
		 		<p>And I love reading! Yep, reading. Not only the tech stuff, as I don't consider that as reading. That's learning. I read quite some history, and phylosophies. And international relations. I read people, or try to read people, as everyone is a unique book. And it's interesting! And I learn things from all that. Valuable things, lessons, etc.</p>
		 		<p>To or not to your surprise, I love cooking! I enjoy it! But well, only if I have people around willing to spend some time eat what I cooked. I cook good in fact. But I found out that in this fast moving world, it is getting harder and harder to have a bunch of friend come to my place relaxing, chatting, and enjoy my dishes.</p>
		 		<p>So, a funny guy, a fast learner, and a guy who loves life!</p>
		 		<p>Now let's take a look at my life so far. Catogorized as below.</p>
